    title="IBS: How Capitalism Cooked Up a Whole New Disease (Part 1 of 2)"
    link="https://kevinkodama.substack.com/p/ibs-how-capitalism-cooked-up-a-whole"
    description="As America became wealthier, companies realized that it wasn’t enough to sell goods that people needed. They also needed to create that need. When it came to food, this was no easy task. After all, people had been eating similar diets for hundreds of years, and this had been working out well for them. The solution to this problem was selling not just a food product but an entire lifestyle. Will Kellogg was the first to take advantage of this strategy. Kellogg’s brother John, a famous physician who pioneered the science of wellness, was obsessed with the idea of “biologic living”, or the idea that scientific optimization could radically alter the human condition for the better. While many of John Kellogg’s ideas feel eccentric now, the essence of his lifestyle is alive and well. Will’s genius was realizing the potential of selling his brother’s science of nutrition with the science of marketing."

    title="Was 'Radical Optimism' a Flop?"
    link="https://synthpop.substack.com/p/was-radical-optimism-a-flop"
    description="Some artists have diehard fanbases that will always come out for them. This is true of certain Main Pop Girls like Taylor Swift, but it is also true of less popular artists who are thus able to punch above their weight. Even though Ed Sheeran is a fair bit more popular than Nicki Minaj, he still has more flop potential due to his more casual fanbase. You could say Sheeran’s fanbase is more fragile. Like Sheeran, Perry had a more fragile fanbase. And so after Witness, her house of cards came tumbling down. I’m not saying anything crazy here; artists with more dedicated fanbases are obviously going to have more success. But I’d like to raise a deeper question: why do some artists have a more dedicated fanbase? And what can artists do to cultivate that image?"

    title="On Spotify, *YOU* Are the Genre"
    link="https://synthpop.substack.com/p/on-spotify-you-are-the-genre"
    description="If you’ve paid close attention to Spotify genres, you might have noticed a genre called 'escape room'. There are other unfamiliar genres, like 'metropopolis', and 'chamber pop', but those at least call to mind a specific vibe. “Escape room' sounds completely nonsensical. This has spawned a number of think pieces about what this term means. These articles make valid points, but a true understanding of escape room requires us to throw out the conventional understanding of genre. Ultimately, the reason for this confusion is a very recent shift in the way genre is defined."

    title="Great Eras: The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of Future Nostalgia"
    link="https://synthpop.substack.com/p/great-eras-the-rise-fall-and-rebirth"
    description="It’s been three years since the release of Future Nostalgia, the album that put Dua Lipa on top of the pop world. Future Nostalgia was the soundtrack of quarantine for many, and it was widely considered one of the best albums of the new decade. Despite Future Nostalgia’s staying power, it didn’t do opening numbers like you might expect. In fact, the album netted zero number ones (yes, even the 2021 year-end chart topper “Levitating”). And the album itself didn’t do great numbers either — it peaked at #3 in the US and didn’t even debut at #1 in the UK."
