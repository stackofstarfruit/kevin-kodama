  <p class="mb-3">I spent a long time trying to find a new home for my app, and I eventually found one: <a class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://render.com/">Render</a>. Render was a relatively small hosting platform that made it easy to port apps over from Heroku. The process had many hiccups (to put it lightly), the most prominent one involving a missing .gitignore file. I was able to deploy it on Render after about a week of effort. However, the code was now out of date, and I wasn't able to fix some of the most critical problems. This left the project dormant yet again.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">After more months of inactivity, a new tool arrived that gave me the inspiration to finish the project: ChatGPT. I had never pair-programmed with a computer assistant before, but ChatGPT had greatly impressed me with its capabilities. For one thing, ChatGPT was able to fix a small bug with my react-select menu, which highlighted the wrong default option. I was really impressed that it could handle such a niche bug, so I wanted to see if it could do more.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">After inspecting several of my React components, ChatGPT finally was able to find the bug that was breaking my application. This allowed me to return to the task of updating the code for the new charts. The most significant change I had to make concerned a new chart location. The charts had switched file hosts from pastebin to past.ee, and I needed to update the code to handle both types of sources. But now that I had ChatGPT, coding was a breeze. It was able to successfully identify bugs as they came up, do menial tasks, and fix some of my messy asynchronous code. After about another week of work, I was able to finally deploy the completed application on Render.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">I submitted the Popheads Chart on Reddit in January, where I got even more recognition than I had received the first time. It felt good to be appreciated for a community that I had been in for so long, and the feedback I got helped me feel satisfied with a long-delayed job well-done. I updated the site intermittently until the summer, at which point I considered the project finished.</p>
