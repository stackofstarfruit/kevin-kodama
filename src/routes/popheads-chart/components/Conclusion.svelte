  <p class="mb-3">As you can see from the top of this page, the chart is still up and running today (at least of this writing).

  <p class="mb-3">As you can see from the top of this page, the chart is still up and running today (at least of this writing). There were a couple hiccups along the way that I had to fix, and my final fluorish was the addition of artist graphs. ChatGPT was invaluable in this process, and I consider it a valuable tool in my coding arsenal.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">Like I said at the begining, there are a thousand things I would have done differently if I were to start this project over again. I would have been able to do everything much more quickly and efficiently with the knowledge that I have today, and I wouldn't have had to spend so many hours slaving away at this web scraping Java code that never should have been used for the task. But on the other hand, that's kind of just what learning how to code is about. That is, struggling through frustrating tasks so you have an appreciation for the proper way to do things when come out the other side. Without the Popheads Chart, I might never have discovered a love for programming. I am thankful for everything it was able to teach me, as well as the Popheads community itself for being such an inspiration.</p>
