<section>
  <p class="mb-3">My final fluorish for the website was a rehash of the landing page, which I felt was no longer taking full advantage of what the website had to offer. Most importantly, I felt that the website was overly oriented towards potential new members. It was easy for new people to quickly get the information they wanted, but it was difficult for existing members to see what the site had to offer.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">To that end, I introduced a brand new Quick Links page. I had just recently been learning about some reactive CSS techniques for my other projects, and I decided that it would be fun to employ some here. I added a function where the buttons fill up with color on hover (you can try this out at <a class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700" href="#quizbowl-header">the top of the page</a>).</p>

  <p class="mb-3">I also replaced the hardcoded schedule of events with an embedded Google Calendar. This was a long-overdue change, and it was unrealistic for the website to be updated as often as needed, even with a webmaster as active as myself at the helm. I had hoped that this could be synced with Discord Events on our server, but Discord Events was a new feature that had not yet been integrated with Google Calendar. This will be a problem for a future webmaster to solve!</p>

  <p class="mb-3">Around this time, I was able to hand over control to a new webmaster: a fellow UW student named Anirudh Kumar. It is my hope that this website will continue to be maintained by the community well into the future!</p>
