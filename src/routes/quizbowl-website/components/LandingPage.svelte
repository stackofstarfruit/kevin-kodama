<section>
  <p class="mb-3">While I had issues with the original website, I initially wanted to keep it as a single-page application. Many websites are far too complicated, and I thought it would be best if I kept it short and sweet. I planned to keep the original section layout of the site the same with only a few changes to the design. You'll notice that I kept many of the original elements, as well as the color palette of the background; in other words, I wasn't just rebuilding the site from the ground up!</p>

  <p class="mb-3">That being said, there were still certainly some changes I wanted to see. I used flexbox to create a banner for the website and to render some YouTube explainer videos that I put on the page. I also added some changes to make sure that the site was compatible with mobile browsing.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">You can see what is roughly the finished design below:</p>
  <img alt="Website after initial redesign" class="m-8 mx-auto" id="medium-site" width="85%" height=auto src="../img/medium-site.png">

  <p class="mb-3">The changes weren't dramatic, but I liked how they came out. The website (and therefore the club) felt more accessible after the redesign. That big old low-res picture was gone, replaced by elements that delivered a much cleaner landing experience. And you could now instantly watch videos explaining what quizbowl when visiting the site, satisfying what I considered to be the primary use case. This was enough to satisfy my needs as president at the time, so I considered the website redesign to be sufficient. The website stayed unchanged in this form for about a year.</p>
