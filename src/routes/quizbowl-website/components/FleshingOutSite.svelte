  <p class="mb-3">After my brief JavaScript adventure, I became dissatisfied with my explanation of quizbowl. The website referred to external explanations of quizbowl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spCgHocfBi0">here</a> and <a href="https://www.pace-nsc.org/resources/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/">here</a>. While I thought these explanation was okay, they were missing a little something. They focused too much on the "what" of quizbowl and not the "why". I wanted to create my own "What Is Quizbowl?" guide that built things up from first principles: one that spent less time on the granular details of quizbowl and more time on how we got here.</p>
