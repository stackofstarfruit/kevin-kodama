  <p>When I became the webmaster of quizbowl, the club website looked like this:</p>
  <img alt="Old version of website" class="m-8 mx-auto" id="old-site" width="85%" height=auto src="../img/old-site.png">

  <p class="mb-3">The old website was okay, but it was relatively bare. There was only one page on the site, and it did not contain much information beyond the basics. In addition, most of the material had not been updated in years.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">First, I thought about what the website was unable to provide. I came up with the following list of what the website needed, in order of priority:</p>

  <ol class="m-3">
    <li><strong>Better landing page</strong>: The original website didn't draw the eye in the way that I wanted it to. My vision was a website that tried to sell you on quizbowl right from the get go. I also thought that more important information should be hitting the user right at load time: for example, I thought it was silly that you learn the names of the officers but not how to contact the club.</li>
    <li><strong>A more thorough explanation of quizbowl</strong>: The quizbowl explanation on the website was okay, but it only gave the most basic facts about the activity. If you wanted to learn more, there was nowhere to go for that information. Since quizbowl is still a relatively unknown activity, that was a problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Better club records</strong>: At the bottom of the old site, there was a link to archived tournament results. This archive had not been updated in a long time. As a "stretch goal", I wanted the site to have a more detailed archive that really gave you a better sense of the club's past.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="mb-3">But before I could do any of that, I had to figure out how to SSH into the student server. The quizbowl website is hosted on vergil, an Apache server for UW students. The old webmaster had long since graduated the university, so I had to figure out most of the hosting logistics myself.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">After a long saga that involved tracking down long-forgotten credentials and downloading many an SSH app, I was finally able to get access to the backend of the site. The interface was simple, but it was pretty clunky and hard to use. I could see why no one had updated the website in a long time...</p>
