  <p class="mb-3">In the end, I feel glad that I was able to leave the quizbowl website better than how I found it. Web development is so concrete and rewarding, especially in a community context. I am happy that I was able to create something that betters the world in some small way.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">And I really am grateful towards this site for being a constant source of learning. This has been my pet project ever since I started learning web development in college. Whenever I learned something new, this site was the first place I would try to apply it. I skipped over this earlier, but I even converted the website into a full-fledged React app for a brief time. (This was very difficult and overkill for this particular project, but I learned a lot from it!)</p>
    
  <p class="mb-3">Learning how to integrate modern techniques with UW's ancient web technology helped me put technological advancements into context. It helped me realize that I really do enjoy the more mundane aspects of web development, like naming pages and putting everything together in a readable format. I really put a lot of love into this website, and I hope that it shows!</p>

  <p class="mb-3">Towards the end of my tenure as webmaster, I managed to find a successor: a fellow UW student named <a class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-t-kumar/">Anirudh Kumar</a>. It is my hope that this website will continue to be passed down for years to come!</p>
